# uCommute
## Intro

uCommute is a Chicago commuting app that allows you to create and save commute trips to your trip list in your profile. You can select a station for the start of the trip, select a station for the end, then name your trip to know what that specific commute is for to never have to struggle remembering how to get around the city!
